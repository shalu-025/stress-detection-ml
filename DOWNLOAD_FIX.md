# Download Functionality Fix

## Issue
The CSV and PDF export functionality was showing success messages but not actually providing download links to users.

## Root Cause
The `export_history` function in `utils.py` was saving files locally and printing success messages, but wasn't returning the data needed for Streamlit's download functionality.

## Solution
1. **Modified `export_history` function** in `utils.py`:
   - Changed return type to return actual data and filename
   - For CSV: Returns the CSV string data and filename
   - For PDF: Returns the PDF bytes data and filename
   - Added proper error handling for PDF encoding

2. **Updated `app.py`**:
   - Replaced simple buttons with `st.download_button`
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback
   - Uses the returned data from `export_history` for downloads

## Changes Made

### utils.py
- Modified `export_history()` to return `(data, filename)` tuple
- Added error handling for PDF encoding issues
- Added fallback encoding methods for PDF generation

### app.py
- Replaced export buttons with `st.download_button` widgets
- Added try-catch blocks for error handling
- Added user feedback for failed exports

## Testing
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python -m streamlit run test_download.py
```

## Usage
1. Run the main application: `python -m streamlit run app.py`
2. Perform some stress analysis sessions
3. Go to the Export section
4. Click "ðŸ“Š Download CSV" or "ðŸ“„ Download PDF" buttons
5. Files will now download properly to your browser's download folder

## File Structure
- `app.py` - Main application with download buttons
- `utils.py` - Export functionality
- `test_download.py` - Test script for download functionality
